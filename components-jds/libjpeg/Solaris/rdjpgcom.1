text comments from a JPEG file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBrdjpgcom\fR [-\fBverbose\fR] [\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrdjpgcom\fR reads the named JPEG or JFIF file, or the standard
input if no file is named, and displays any text comments found in the file
on the standard output\&.
.PP
The JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG
file\&. Although the standard does not actually define the intended function
of COM blocks, they are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings\&. This
enables you to add annotations, titles, index terms, and so on to your JPEG
files, and later retrieve the COM blocks as text\&. COM blocks do not interfere
with the image stored in the JPEG file\&. The maximum size of a COM block is
64K, but you can have many COM blocks in one JPEG file\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fBverbose\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Causes \fBrdjpgcom\fR
to also display the JPEG image dimensions\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.SH "OPERANDS"
.PP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
The name of the JPEG file that contains text comments\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrdjpgcom\fR does not depend on the IJG JPEG library\&. The \fBrdjpgcom\fR
source code is intended to illustrate the minimum amount of code required
to parse a JPEG file header correctly\&. 
.PP
In -\fBverbose\fR mode, \fBrdjpgcom\fR also attempts
to display the contents of any "APP12" markers as text\&. Some digital cameras
produce APP12 markers that contain useful textual information\&. You can also
modify the source code to display other APP\fIn\fR
marker types\&.
