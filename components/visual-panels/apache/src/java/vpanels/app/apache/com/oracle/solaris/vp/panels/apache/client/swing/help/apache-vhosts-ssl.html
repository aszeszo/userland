<a name="apache-vhosts-ssl"></a><h4>SSL Settings for an Apache Virtual Host</h4>
<p>The SSL tab associated with each virtual host is used to enable encryption
with secure HTTP over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL provides for secure
communication between client and server. The URLs needed to access this virtual host
would start with <tt>https:</tt> instead of <tt>http:</tt>. After selecting the SSL tab you
can make the following configuration changes:</p>


<ul><li><p>Enable or disable SSL</p>

</li>
<li><p>IP address</p>

</li>
<li><p>Port</p>

</li>
<li><p>Location of the certificate file which includes all of the certificate file for the server and also to the corresponding RSA or DSA private key file, if needed</p>

</li>
<li><p>Location of the key file which includes the private key for the server</p>

</li></ul>
