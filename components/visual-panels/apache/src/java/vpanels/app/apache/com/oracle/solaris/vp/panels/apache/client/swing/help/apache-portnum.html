<a name="apache-portnum"></a><h4>Why Would I Change the Port Number for a Virtual Host?</h4>
<p>By default, the Apache service listens for requests on port 80 and on
all IP addresses configured on the local host. By selecting a specific port
you can determine how each virtual host responds to different IP addresses, host
names and ports. This is equivalent to the <tt>Listen</tt> directive.</p>

<p>Multiple virtual hosts can listen on the same port. If there is ambiguity
as to which virtual host should serve a particular request, first the domain
names of the virtual hosts is compared with the domain name in the
incoming request. If they match then the matching virtual host is used. If
no match is found or no domain name was used in the request,
then one of the virtual hosts defined for that port is used.</p>
