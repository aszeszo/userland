<a name="usermgr-namesvcscope"></a><h4>Selecting a Name-Service Scope and Type</h4>
<p>The default name-service scope and type for User Manager is <tt>files</tt> and
<tt>User</tt>. To administer the tool within a different scope, for example <tt>ldap</tt>
and <tt>roles</tt>, click the Filter... button. Clicking the Filter... button launches a dialog
that enables you to change the default scope and, or, type. Choices for
Scope include <tt>files</tt> and <tt>ldap</tt>. Choices for Type include <tt>User</tt> and <tt>Role</tt>.
Click OK to save the changes or click Cancel to cancel the operation.</p>


<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If the system is not configured as an <tt>ldap</tt> client, only the <tt>files</tt>
scope is available.</p>


<hr>

<hr><p><b>Tip - </b>To filter certain criteria, for example, all of the users or roles that
start with the letter &#8220;a&#8221;, enter a search string in the Matches 
field.</p>
