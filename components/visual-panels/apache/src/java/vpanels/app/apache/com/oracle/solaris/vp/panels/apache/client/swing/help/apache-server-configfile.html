<a name="apache-server-configfile"></a><h4>Why Would I Use a Custom Configuration File with the Apache Server?</h4>
<p>The Apache Web Server panel does not provide access to all Apache configuration
options. If your Apache configuration is too complex to be represented in the
Apache Web Server panel, you can use the custom configuration file option to
identify a complete Apache configuration file instead. A custom configuration file overrides all
other settings made in the Apache Web Server panel. This option is also
useful when you have a pre-existing Apache configuration file you wish to reuse.</p>
