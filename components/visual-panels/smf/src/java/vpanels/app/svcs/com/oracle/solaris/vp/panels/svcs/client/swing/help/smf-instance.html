of the panel, a list of the service instances is displayed on the
right. From the list you can perform the following operations:</p>


<ul><li><p>Enter a string of characters to use when displaying a shorter list of services in the Filter field. For instance, &#8220;nfs&#8221; selects all of the services that have &#8220;nfs&#8221; in their name. Note that you must clear this field to stop filtering.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Sort the list by selecting the button displaying the name of the column you would like to sort the list by. Toggle the column name button to get the entries in ascending or descending order.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Select a service and then enable or disable the service instance. In addition, by double-clicking a service you can display a window with even more information about each service or each service instance. The following tabs are available:</p>
