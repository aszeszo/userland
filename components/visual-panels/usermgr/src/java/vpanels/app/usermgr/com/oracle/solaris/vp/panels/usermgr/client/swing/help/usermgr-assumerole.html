<p>Any user with the <tt>User Management</tt> rights profile can create new users, provided that
the advanced attributes of the user or role to be created is a
subset of those of the user who is performing the administration. If the
user who is performing the administration does not have sufficient authorizations, but has
an administrative role with sufficient authorizations, the user can assume that role to
perform the necessary administration by clicking the Lock button in the main User
Manager panel.</p>


<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The authorizations and rights that are required to manage users and roles with
User Manager are assigned through the application. The application both uses and provides
authorizations.</p>
