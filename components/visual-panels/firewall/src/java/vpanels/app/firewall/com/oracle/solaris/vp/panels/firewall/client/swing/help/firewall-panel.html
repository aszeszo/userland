<a name="firewall-panel"></a><h4>The Service Firewall Panel</h4>
<p>The Service Firewall panel is used to configure system-wide or service-specific firewall policy
settings. The top of the Service Firewall panel includes two pieces of information.
The Status field on the left shows if the service is enabled or
not. The User field on the right shows the credential that is being
used by the tool. If you click on the lock button on the
far right, you can change the credentials. See <a href="firewall-authentication.html">Changing User Credentials</a> for more information about
changing the user credentials.</p>

<p>The panel displays different tabs depending on the firewall policy that is selected
in the left hand list:</p>


<ul><li><p>Default Settings &#8211; From this screen, the settings for all services enabled on the system can be set. See <a href="firewall-default.html">Default Settings for the System-Wide Firewall Policy</a> for more information.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Open Program Settings &#8211; From this pane, ports and protocols can be configure to allow incoming traffic. See <a href="firewall-open.html">Open Programs Settings for the System-Wide Firewall Policy</a> for more information.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Override Settings &#8211; This tab is used to configure policies that override service specific policies that are set. See <a href="firewall-override.html">Override Settings for the System-Wide Firewall Policy</a> for more information.</p>

</li></ul>
