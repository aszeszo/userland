wrjpgcom \- insert
text comments into a JPEG file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBwrjpgcom\fR [-\fBreplace\fR] [-\fBcomment \fItext\fR\fR] [-\fBcfile \fIname\fR\fR] [\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBwrjpgcom\fR reads the named JPEG or JFIF file, or the standard
input if no file is named, and generates a new JPEG or JFIF file on the standard
output\&. A comment block is added to the file\&.
.PP
The JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG
file\&. Although the standard does not actually define the intended function
of COM blocks, they are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings\&. This
enables you to add annotations, titles, index terms, and so on to your JPEG
files, and later retrieve the COM blocks as text\&. COM blocks do not interfere
with the image stored in the JPEG file\&. The maximum size of a COM block is
64K, but you can have many COM blocks in one JPEG file\&.
.PP
\fBwrjpgcom\fR adds a COM block, containing text that you
provide, to a JPEG file\&. Ordinarily, the COM block is added after any existing
COM blocks, but you can delete the old COM blocks if you wish\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB-\fBcfile \fIname\fR\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Read the text for a new COM block from the named file\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.sp
.ne 2

\fB-\fBcomment \fItext\fR\fR\fR

Supply the text for a new COM block on the command line\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n

\fB-\fBreplace\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
Delete
any existing COM blocks from the file\&.
.sp

.SH "OPERANDS"
.PP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
\fB\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR\fR
.in +16n
.rt
The name of the JPEG file to which you want to add text comments\&.
.sp
.sp 1
.in -16n
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.PP
To add only one line of comment text, use the -\fBcomment\fR
option to provide the text on the command line\&. Specify the comment text within
quotes, so that the text is treated as a single argument\&. Longer comments
can be read from a text file\&.
.PP
If you specify neither the -\fBcomment\fR nor the -\fBcfile\fR option, \fBwrjpgcom\fR reads the comment text from
standard input\&. In such cases, you must supply an input image filename\&. You
can enter multiple lines, up to 64KB\&. Type an end-of-file indicator, usually
Ctrl-D, to terminate the comment text entry\&.
.PP
\fBwrjpgcom\fR does not add a COM block if the provided comment
string is empty\&. Therefore, you can use -\fBreplace\fR -\fBcomment ""\fR to delete all COM blocks from a file\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

\fBExample 1: Adding a Short Comment to in\&.jpg to Produce out\&.jpg\fR

In this example, 1000 is a number that is larger than the number of
rows in the source file\&.
