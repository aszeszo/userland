# Note that the 2.10 version of the compressed GNU grep tarball on
# ftp.gnu.org is only available in .xz format. We cannot use this
# as xz is not currently part of the Solaris 11 Update CBE. We 
# have recompressed that tarball as a .bz2 file and placed it in the
# special Userland cache. The sha1 hash is for the payload .tar file.
