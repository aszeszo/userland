<a name="apache-mimetypes"></a><h4>What are MIME Types in the Apache Service?</h4>
<p>The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types configuration file defines the mappings from
file name extensions (like .html) to content types (like text/plain or text/html). The
behavior defines any handlers or filters that need to be used. The GUI
allows you to add new MIME types, which is equivalent to using the
<tt>AddType</tt> directive in Apache configuration file.</p>

<p>Most virtual hosts will not need any custom MIME types defined. These hosts
can rely on the default MIME settings to handle their requests. Occasionally, a
virtual host needs to serve a file for which a MIME type is
not defined, or for which an existing MIME type needs to be overridden.
For example, a virtual host may want to serve sound files with a
<tt>.snd</tt> extension, with the MIME type <tt>audio/x-audiphile-sound</tt>.</p>

<p>The following operations are supported from the Custom MIME types popup:</p>


<ul><li><p>A MIME type can be added or deleted</p>

</li>
<li><p>Properties of a MIME type can be edited</p>

</li></ul>
<p>Each MIME type has the following properties:</p>


<ul><li><p>The MIME type (major type in Apache documentation) &#8211; such as text or image</p>

</li>
<li><p>The MIME subtype (minor type in Apache documentation) &#8211; such as plain, html or jpeg</p>

</li>
<li><p>The appropriate extensions &#8211; such as .text, .html or .jpeg</p>

</li></ul>
<p>Multiple extensions can be added at one time. The extensions must start with
a dot &#8220;.&#8221;. The multiple entries can be separated by commas or a
space (such as jpeg, .jpg).</p>
