<a name="coreadm-settings"></a><h4>Settings for Core Files</h4>
<p>When the Settings tab is selected, you can configure whether core files are
generated and how the files are stored. Two types of core files can
be created by the system. A per-process core file is owned and can
be examined by the owner of the process that terminated. A global core
file is owned by root. The contents of a per-process and a global
core file for an event can be identical, depending on the content options
that are selected.</p>

<p>The following pre-set configuration schemes are available:</p>


<ul><li><p>Do not generate any core files</p>

</li>
<li><p>Store the core files in the current directory</p>

</li>
<li><p>Store the core files in the current directory with a name including the application name and the process ID</p>

</li>
<li><p>Store core files in global location</p>

</li></ul>
<p>If none of the pre-set schemes are sufficient, a custom scheme can be
created. See <a href="coreadm-custom.html">Settings for Core File Management</a> for more information about how to customize core file management.</p>
