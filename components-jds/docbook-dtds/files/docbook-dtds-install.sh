# Historic versions of this scriptlet contained the following comment:
# <quote>
# Fix up SGML super catalog so that there isn't an XML DTD before an
# SGML one.  We need to do this (*sigh*) because xmlcatalog messes up
# the order of the lines, and SGML tools don't like to see XML things
# they aren't expecting.
# </quote>
# But the code that followed just found the first XML DTD and the first
# SGML DTD, swappinmg these two lines if the XML one preceded.
# But that only ensures that there is an SGML DTD before all XML ones.
# No one complained, so either this was enough, or the buggy SGML tools
# are long dead, or their users do not use bugzilla.
# Anyway, the following code, introduced in 1.0-46, does better: it ensures
# that all XML DTDs are after all SGML ones, by moving them to the end.
