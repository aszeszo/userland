<a name="apache-modules"></a><h4>What are Apache Modules?</h4>
<p>An Apache module can enable operating system specific optimizations, manage how requests are
handled by the server, and define other important parameters. Most virtual hosts will
not need any custom modules added. These hosts can rely on the default
modules. Currently, the default modules are in <tt>/etc/apache2/2.2/conf.d/modules-[32|64]</tt>. Occasionally, a virtual host needs to
use some custom functionality not included in the Apache core module set. For
example, a virtual host may have extensive dynamic content written in PHP. To
get the Apache service to handle this content properly, the <tt>mod_php</tt> module would need
to be added.</p>

<p>From the Custom Modules popup, you can add or delete an Apache module.
Each module entry includes a name and the name of a shared library
file associated with it. Each name must be unique.</p>
