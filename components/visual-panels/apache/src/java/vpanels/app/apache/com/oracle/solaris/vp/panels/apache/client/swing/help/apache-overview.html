<a name="apache-overview"></a><h4>The Apache Web Server Panel</h4>
<p>The Apache Web service can be configured to make web pages visible on
the World Wide Web. Several web sites can be supported from one web
server by configuring many virtual hosts. The Apache Web Server panel is used
to configure global settings for all virtual hosts on the local system or
to configure individual virtual hosts.</p>

<p>At the top of the Apache Web Server panel are two pieces
of information. The Status field on the left shows if the web server is
enabled or not. The User field on the right shows the credential that
is being used by the tool. If you click on the lock
button on the far right, you can change the credential. See <a href="apache-authentication.html">Changing User Credentials</a> for more
information about changing the user credentials.</p>

<p>The panel includes the following components:</p>


<ul><li><p>Global Settings &#8211; From this pane, the global settings for all virtual hosts configured on the system can be set. See <a href="apache-global.html">Global Settings for the Apache Web Service</a> for more information.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Virtual Hosts: General Settings &#8211; From this pane, several configuration parameters can be set. See <a href="apache-vhosts-general.html">General Settings for an Apache Virtual Host</a> for more information.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Virtual Hosts: SSL Settings &#8211; This tab is used to configure encryption using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). See <a href="apache-vhosts-ssl.html">SSL Settings for an Apache Virtual Host</a> for more information.</p>

</li></ul>
