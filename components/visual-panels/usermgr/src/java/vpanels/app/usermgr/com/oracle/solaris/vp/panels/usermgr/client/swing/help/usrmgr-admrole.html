<a name="usrmgr-admrole"></a><h4>Administering Roles</h4>

<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The roles attribute is available <b>only</b> for a user, <b>not</b> for a role,
because roles can only be assigned to users.</p>


<hr>
<p>To administer roles, select a user in the main User Manager panel,
then click the Advanced Settings... button, which opens the Advanced Settings panel. Click the Roles
attribute on the left side of the panel to display a list of
the available roles and a list of the roles that are assigned to
the current user.</p>

<p>To assign a role, or multiple roles, to a user, select the
role (or roles) from the Available Roles list, then click Add. The role is
displayed in the Assigned Roles list. To remove a role from the Assigned
Roles list, select the group, then click Remove. Clicking the Add All or the
Remove All button adds or removes all of the roles that are assigned to
the current user.</p>

<p>Click OK to save the settings. Note that the changes are not
applied to the current user until you click Apply or OK in the
main User Manager panel.</p>
