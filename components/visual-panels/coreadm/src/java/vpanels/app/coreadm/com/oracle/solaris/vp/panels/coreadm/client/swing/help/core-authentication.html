<a name="core-authentication"></a><h4>Changing User Credentials</h4>
<p>Most panels let you make changes as a different user or role, as
well as making changes on a remote host.  To change who you
are authenticated as or which system you want to administer, click the credentials
icon in the top right hand corner of the window, next to the
username.  A dialog will open, prompting for a host and username. After
clicking the "Log In" button, you may be prompted to enter a password
or other system-defined credentials. If the user is already authenticated in another session,
you may not be prompted for a password.</p>

<p>After successfully authenticating as the specified user, you may be prompted to select
a role if any roles are assigned to the selected user. From this
dialog you may choose one of the roles or leave the entry as
<tt>none</tt>. After selecting a role, you may again be prompted for any necessary
passwords or credentials.</p>
