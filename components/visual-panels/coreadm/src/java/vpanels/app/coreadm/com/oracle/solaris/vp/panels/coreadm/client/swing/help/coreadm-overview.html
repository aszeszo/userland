<a name="coreadm-overview"></a><h4>Core Files Panel</h4>
<p>The Core Files Panel can be used to configure the names, locations and
contents of core files that are generated by the system. To write scripts
to manage core files, see the <tt>coreadm</tt>(1M) man page.</p>

<p>The top of the Core Files panel includes two pieces of information. The
Status field on the left shows if the service is enabled or
not. The User field on the right shows the credential that is being
used by the tool. If you click on the lock button on the
far right, you can change the credentials. See <a href="core-authentication.html">Changing User Credentials</a> for more information about
changing the user credentials.</p>

<p>The panel includes the following components:</p>


<ul><li><p>Core Files Tab &#8211; This tab lists all of the core files that are on the system. See <a href="coreadm-selector.html">Core File Selection</a> for more information.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Settings Tab &#8211; This tab allows you to view or edit the core file generation settings. See <a href="coreadm-settings.html">Settings for Core Files</a> for more information.</p>

</li></ul>
