<a name="smf-overview"></a><h4>The SMF Services Panel</h4>
<p>SMF Service management can be used to monitor, configure, enable or disable services
on the local system.</p>

<p>The top of the SMF Services panel includes two pieces of information. The
Status field on the left shows the status of the services running on
the local host. The User field on the right shows the credential that
is being used by the tool. If you click on the lock
button on the far right, you can change the credentials. See <a href="smf-authentication.html">Changing User Credentials</a> for more
information about changing the user credentials.</p>

<p>The SMF Services panel lists all of the services that are installed. The
panel includes two major components:</p>


<ul><li><p>Service selector &#8211; On the left side of the panel you can select which group of services you want to see displayed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Service instances &#8211; On the right side of the panel is displayed a list of all of the services in the group you have selected. See <a href="smf-instance.html">SMF Service Instances</a> for more information.</p>

</li></ul>
