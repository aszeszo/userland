<a name="coreadm-filename"></a><h4>Customizing the Core File Name Pattern</h4>
<p>The core file name pattern is a file name which includes the full
path and may include embedded variables. The variables are specified using a leading
&#8220;%&#8221; character. The meaning of these variables is expanded when the core file
is generated by the operating system. These are the embedded variables that are
available:</p>


<ul><li><p><tt>%d</tt> &#8211; Executable file directory name</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%f</tt> &#8211; Executable file name</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%g</tt> &#8211; Effective group ID</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%m</tt> &#8211; Machine name (<tt>uname</tt> <tt>-m</tt>)</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%n</tt> &#8211; System node name (<tt>uname</tt> <tt>-n</tt>)</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%p</tt> &#8211; Process ID</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%t</tt> &#8211; Decimal value of Unix time</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%u</tt> &#8211; Effective user ID</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%z</tt> &#8211; Name of the zone in which the process was executed (<tt>zonename</tt>)</p>

</li>
<li><p><tt>%%</tt> &#8211; Literal &#8220;%&#8221;</p>

</li></ul>
